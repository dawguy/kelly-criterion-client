"The Kelly criterion is a formula used to determine the optimal size of a series of bets in order to maximize wealth. It is often described as optimizing the logarithm of wealth, and will do better than any other strategy in the long run."

The goal of this project is to get better at Clojure and ClojureScript while working on something that I will find useful to refer back to when making investments and future Clojure projects.

Blog/Writeups of the challenges I encountered can be found in this repo:

(This was my second ClojureScript project. https://github.com/dawguy/Blog/tree/main/Rowing contains the posts about getting my ClojureScript environment set up and interacting with a live database.)
